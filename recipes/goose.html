    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Maybe save this one for a dinner party. But the good news is that if you find it on the road, it’s still totally usable, don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. That’s good meat, no matter where it comes from. Just wash it off. You’ll need a good tangy recipe to get that gamey flavor out.</p>
